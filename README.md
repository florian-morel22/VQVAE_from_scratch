# VQVAE_from_scratch

Development project of a VQ-VAE model from scratch on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Project instruction :

You will work with the Fashion MNIST dataset, aiming to implement a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) capable of generating images from this dataset. Begin by splitting the dataset into training and test sets. While keeping the implementation straightforward, focus on developing a creative applying data science techniques to uncover interesting patterns or insights within the generated data.
